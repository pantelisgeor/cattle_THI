## Abstract
Cattle farming, a critical agricultural activity, faces economic losses due to heat stress influenced by temperature and humidity. Using the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) as a non-invasive measure, we analyzed a novel global dataset with hourly THI projections through the century's end. We evaluated the duration and intensity of thermal stress periods and waves under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios, mapping these projections against current cattle distribution data. Our findings indicate that severe heat stress will significantly challenge future cattle farming, with the Americas, Africa, and South-East Asia projected to experience the most substantial increases in thermal stress conditions, highlighting areas where targeted adaptation strategies will be necessary.
